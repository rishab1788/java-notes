/**
 * Some of the cool features provided by Spring Data JPA are:
 *
 *
 * Reduce code size for generic CRUD operations by using CrudRepository
 * Create and support repositories created with Spring and JPA
 * Support QueryDSL and JPA queries
 * Audit of domain classes
 * Support for batch loading, sorting, dynamical queries
 * Supports XML mapping for entities
 *
 *
 * When to use Spring Data JPA?
 * I would say that if you need to quickly create a JPA-based repository layer that is mainly for CRUD operations,
 * and you do not want to create abstract DAO, implementing interfaces, Spring Data JPA is a good choice.
