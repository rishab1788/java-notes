polymorhism -one name but multiple forms is he conecept of polymorphism

example -1- method name is the same but we can apply for diffrent types of arguments ##overloading

Abs(int x)
Abs(float x)
Abs (long x)


example-2-method signature is same but in parent class one type of implemetnation and in the child class another type of implemenation
          this concept is overriding

          calss p{

          marrty(int x) {

          //shubh}

          }
class c
{

marry(int x) {

//lucky}
}


example -3 -usage of parent class refrence to hold child object is the concept of polymorhism is also concernd as polymorphism
