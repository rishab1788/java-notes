/**
 *
 * JRE = JVM + class libraries (rt.jar)  + other libraries (if any).
 *  - The JRE is mainly a container for those other components,
 *    and is responsible for orchestrating their activities.
 *
 *     The Java Runtime Environment is a software layer that runs on top of a computer's operating system
 *     , providing additional services specific to Java.
 *
 *
 *     The JRE smooths over the diversity of operating systems, ensuring that Java programs can run on virtually any OS without modification. It also provides value-added services. Automatic memory management is one of the JRE's most important services,
 *     ensuring that programmers don't have to manually control the allocation and reallocation of memory.
 *
 *
 *  The JRE in devops
 *  The JRE is not very noticeable in the development stage, where it mostly just runs your programs in the OS or IDE of your choice. The JRE plays
 *  a slightly more prominent role in devops and systems administration because it's used for monitoring and configuration.
