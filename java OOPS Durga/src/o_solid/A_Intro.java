/** SOLID principle are an object oriented approach that are applied to software structure design.
 *
 *
 * Poorly designed applications can lead the team to very difficult situations when the application scope goes up,
 * or the implementation faces certain design issues either in production or maintenance.
 *
 * On the other hand, a set of well designed and written classes can speed up the coding process,
 * while reducing the tech debt and the number of bugs in comparison.
 *
 * Single Responsibility Principle -> “One class should have one and only one responsibility”
