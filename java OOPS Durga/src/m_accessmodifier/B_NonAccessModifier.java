  /**
   *  Do not control access level, but provides other functionality.
   * There are four non-access modifiers in Java. They are as follows:
   (i). Static  - Attributes and methods belongs to the class, rather than an object.

   (ii). Final - Attributes and methods cannot be overridden/modified.

   (iii). Abstract - Can only be used in an abstract class, and can only be used on methods.
                     The method does not have a body, for example abstract void run();.

   (iv). Synchronization - Methods can only be accessed by one thread at a time.
   (V).  volatile  - Volatile keyword is used to modify the value of a variable by different threads.
                      It is also used to make classes thread safe.
                      It means that multiple threads can use a method and instance of the classes at the same time without any problem. ...
                      However, it is used with variables.
